This project links to the "Mini-XML" library, which is Copyright 2003-2010 by Michael R Sweet.
    1. Static linking of applications to the Mini-XML library
    does not constitute a derivative work and does not require
    the author to provide source code for the application, use
    the shared Mini-XML libraries, or link their applications
    against a user-supplied version of Mini-XML.
    If you link the application to a modified version of
    Mini-XML, then the changes to Mini-XML must be provided
    under the terms of the LGPL2 in sections 1, 2, and 4.
    2. You do not have to provide a copy of the Mini-XML license
    with programs that are linked to the Mini-XML library, nor
    do you have to identify the Mini-XML license in your
    program or documentation as required by section 6 of the
    LGPL2.
